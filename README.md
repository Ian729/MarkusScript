# MarkusScript
The goal is to automate markus lookup

## Installation
1. Download the script(download or clone)
2. Run the script from command line(python markus_script)
3. input username and password

## Next step
Done~~1. Add check points(compare online score with local version, if different, send a text message to user's phone)~~  
Done~~2. Add automation(cron or other automation tool)~~  

## Some thoughts:  
I think the best way to automate this script is rent a server and have a cron task to automate it.  
To learn more about cron, `man cron`
